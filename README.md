### CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
NVIDIA's proprietary platform for general-purpose computing on its GPUs (GPGPU). It's not just a language; it's a complete software stack that includes:
1. **CUDA C/C++:** An extension to standard C/C++ that allows developers to define functions (called "kernels") that can be executed in parallel on the GPU.
2. **A Parallel Programming Model:** CUDA introduces a hierarchical thread model (grids, blocks, threads) that maps directly to the underlying hardware architecture.
3. **Tools:** A suite of development tools, including compilers (nvcc), debuggers, and profilers, which are indispensable for performance analysis and optimization, especially when studying memory hierarchy effects.
4. **Libraries:** A rich set of optimized libraries that provide highly optimized implementations of common parallel algorithms, often leveraging the specific memory and computational capabilities of the GPU.
