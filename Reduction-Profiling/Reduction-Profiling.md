## Key Differences and Observations

- **Hardware Difference**: The use of the Tesla T4 GPU provides a technological advantage over the GE80 GPU (Tesla Arch) used in the NVIDIA webinar. This newer hardware delivers superior performance characteristics, as evidenced by the more efficient execution in the initial implementations.
  
- **Thread Configuration**: Utilizing 256 threads per block has enabled more granular control over the parallelism, allowing for optimizations that are more closely aligned with the capabilities of the Tesla T4.

- **Performance and Speedup**:
  - Despite the performance improvements in initial tests due to advanced hardware, the relative speedup observed in subsequent optimizations was less pronounced. This is likely due to the already optimized performance of the base case, which leaves less room for dramatic improvements.
  - The speedup is evident, but not as significant as seen in the original webinar. This suggests that the initial performance benefits from using a more advanced GPU may diminish the impact of further algorithmic optimizations.
